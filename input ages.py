Print""""Did you ever hear the tragedy of ",name,"? I thought not.
It’s not a story the ",noun2," would tell you. It’s a Sith legend.
",Noun3," was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so ",adjective," he could use
the Force to influence the midichlorians to create ",noun4,"… He had such a knowledge
of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from ",verb,".
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be
",adjectives2,". He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was
",something_not_wanting_to_be_lost," which eventually, of course, he did.
Unfortunately, he taught his ",someone_beneath_main_thing," everything he knew,
then his apprentice ",verb2," him in his sleep.Ironic.
He could save others from death,but not himself."
